					<h1>About Us</h1>
					<div> 
						<p>Welcome to Moobly Krew: the production house for the startup musician. We entered this world in 2019 with a boom, a bang, and a contractual signing with the state of Massachusetts. John Scovell, self-proclaimed Owner and CEO, decided that he needed one of those fancy music companies that he learned about at music school. Something absolutely crazy and innovative. Something wild that fused all the best parts of the modern music industry. He needed a music publisher, a record label, a booking agency, a production house, and a recording studio - an all-in-one music shop for the hardworking DIY artist of the future!</p>
						<p>Truth be told, it began long ago, back in the dark ages of 2015. John had just entered the University of New Haven for music and sound recording, and he needed a gnarly rock band to play out at New Haven DIY basement shows. This led to the formation of Sonar Shack. For four years, they played countless gigs throughout the Northeast, and recorded and released an awesome album called Love in Odd Forms.</p>
						<p>The end of college marked a parting of ways for Sonar Shack, though their music still lives on through an innovative and amazing company called…Moobly Krew! Let’s see, we are now in the summer of 2019. John was lost! He didn’t know what to do. He thought Subpop would have signed Sonar Shack by then! Well, he did the only thing that he could’ve done: started a music livestream show called Explain Myself with Me. This (now archived) variety show was a worthy predecessor of Moobly Krew. It connected John with working artists around the world, such as Evan Moxie Kitchener, Awyang, and the legendary Citrus Boi. By the end of that summer, Explain Myself with Me had surpassed an astounding 100 episodes. And unsurprisingly, John was ready for a new challenge: MOOBLY KREW!!!</p>
						<p>Soon enough, John was recording an eclectic indie rock noise opera for Blazers Over Turtlenecks, releasing absurdo electronica madness under Scove Cone, distributing Sonar Shack’s second full-length album, injecting Binary Scriptures into the world, profiteering Horticulture’s self-titled LP, and publishing the Vibez the Great official catalog. And that is just the beginning! </p>
						<p>A huge development for the Moobly Krew franchise began in the fall of 2021 with the creation and implementation of Live at Deadmoon. This live and in-person concert series takes place inside a professional recording studio, and has been a fantastic way to showcase and meet new and up-and-coming artists. Check them out for yourself!</p>
